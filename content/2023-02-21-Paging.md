When dividing memory into segments ([Segmentation](https://john-rodewald.github.io/blog/segmentation)), each segment may have a different size. When paging, memory is divided into fixed-size *pages*. 

Virtual memory is divided into *pages* while physical memory is divided into *page frames*. A page maps to a physical page frame. Pages and page frames are typically aligned and of the same size. 

Each virtual address consists of a *virtual page number* and an *offset into that page*. 

During address translation, the virtual page number must be translated to point to the correct *physical page frame*. The offset into the physical page frame is the same as the offset into the virtual page and so it needs no translation.
