Transparent, clear resin can make for interesting results. Compared to other resins, it has two interesting properties:

- Light passes through clear resin much more easily
- Light is much more likely to bleed

This means that fine detail is difficult to achieve (*impossible, in my experience*). Light bleeding means resin cures in places it shouldn't and detail is lost. The effect is further amplified because a higher exposure time is needed.

It's likely that these problems are the reason clear resin can often be bought for a lower price than other colours. If transparency is not strictly needed, alcohol ink can help restore the ability to print fine detail for cheap.

Adding between 0.5 % and 1 % alcohol ink to any amount of clear resin will visibly tint the resin (obviously). More importantly, this ratio decreases light bleeding by enough to vastly improve fine details.
