This blog is built with Nix and Zola. Publishing things is easy enough by pushing markdown files to the repository. The theme needs expansion for my needs:

- Allow filtering by tags
	- The point of Zettelkasten is to organise notes by metadata. No such thing is possible yet.
- Split content into sections
	- There are many types of content in a Zettelkasten, but everything is displayed in the same manner at the moment. I'd like to keep reading notes in a separate section towards the bottom of the page, for example.
- Streamline the pipeline from Obsidian -> Zola
	- Both Obsidian and Zola have separate DSLs. Zola expects dates in filenames which Obsidian struggles to provide in an ergonomic way. Obsidian's front matter is formatted in a slightly different way. These issues mean it's a small hassle to publish anything. 

Still, I'm quite happy with how lightweight everything has turned out. I think my main motivation behind publishing here is not necessarily to provide a polished blog-reading experience. It's to dump my mind in a more or less organised way and allow anyone with an interest to dig through it.

A future technology I'd like to investigate is [Emanote](https://emanote.srid.ca/).
